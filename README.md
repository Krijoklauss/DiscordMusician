# DiscordMusician
This is a simple MusicBot i wrote in Python, all features and upcomming updates explained below 

 - Intention
   -  This whole bot was basically an idea i had a while ago already.
      But the first time i used the Bot for my own Discord only and havent released it to the public.
      This time i will keep this bot updated for everyone and push updates whenever i find time to edit something.
      Keep in mind, im programming this bot all by myself and I have some more projects running in the background!
      So please just dont ask for next updates or something like that!
 

 - Functions
    - The MusicBot is able to play Music on multiple DiscordServers simultaniously
    - Commands
      -  prefix
      -  nick
      -  bind
      -  play
      -  pause
      -  stop
      -  resume
      -  loop (Coming soon!)
      -  loopqueue (Coming soon!)
      -  queue
      -  seek (Currently broken!)
      -  clear
      -  cleaner
      -  help
      -  lang
      -  languages


-  Upcoming updates
   -  Working on Spotify playlist implementation (Currently only YouTube is working except single songs!)
   -  Working on new loop function
   -  Working on the seek functions which is currently locked due to very slow performance

-  Latest updates
   - Added the command 'teams', which will split up the members of your current voicechannel into two parts. The percentage of how they are split can be set with 'percentage VALUE'. One half will be randomly moved to another voicechannel (I made it for a game called Perfect Heist 2, but you can obviously use it for anything to create some teams)

-  Config
      If you want to use this Bot on your Server you can either inivite it by using this link *COMING SOON*,
      or by making it your own Bot. You need to go to your Discord applications and then create a new application, add
      a new bot to the application, invite the bot to your server and put the token inside the main.py file.
      
      I stored my discord tokens in a .json file and im loading them in at lines 16-18.
      You can either create your own json file and load that in or delete
      line 17 and 18 and just set token to *YOUR_NEW_TOKEN*

      This is the link to the discord applications: 'https://discord.com/developers/applications'
      This Video may be a little old but you find something about creating bots and inviting them to your server here: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVedJuBojF8'

      If this wont help you just send me a message to 'musician-bot@protonmail.com'!
      I'll try to answer all your questions there =)


-  Other things
   -  As i said in the beginning of this README im a single programmer working on this.
      I'll try my best to keep it updated and push new things every month.
