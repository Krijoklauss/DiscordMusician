# DiscordMusician
This is a simple MusicBot i wrote in Python, all features and upcomming updates explained below 

 - Intention
   -  This whole bot was basically an idea i had a while ago already.
      But the first time i used the Bot for my own Discord only and havent released it to the public.
      This time i will keep this bot updated for everyone and push updates whenever i find time to edit something.
      Keep in mind, im programming this bot all by myself and I have some more projects running in the background!
      So please just dont ask for next updates or something like that!
 
 - Functions
    - The MusicBot is able to play Music on multiple DiscordServers simultaniously
    - Commands
      -  prefix
      -  nick
      -  bind
      -  play
      -  pause
      -  stop
      -  resume
      -  loop (Coming soon!)
      -  loopqueue (Coming soon!)
      -  queue
      -  seek (Currently broken!)
      -  clear
      -  cleaner
      -  say
      -  help
      -  lang
      -  languages

-  Upcoming updates
   -  Working on new loop function
   -  Working on the seek functions which is currently locked due to very slow performance

-  Latest updates
   - Added new command "say" which creates an mp3 from text and says whatever it is
     in the language currently set
   - Added full language names to the command "languages"
   - Added spotify playlists to the "play" command

-  Config
   If you want to use this Bot on your Server you can either inivite it by using this link *COMING SOON*,
   or by making it your own Bot. You need to go to your Discord applications and then create a new application, add
   a new bot to the application, invite the bot to your server and put the token inside the main.py file.
   
   I stored my discord tokens in a .json file and im loading them in at lines 16-18.
   You can either create your own json file and load that in or delete
   line 17 and 18 and just set token to *YOUR_NEW_TOKEN*

   This is the link to the discord applications: 'https://discord.com/developers/applications'
   This Video may be a little old but you find something about creating bots and inviting them to your server here: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVedJuBojF8'

   If this wont help you just send me a message to 'musician-bot@protonmail.com'!
   I'll try to answer all your questions there =)

-  Other things
   -  As i said in the beginning of this README im a single programmer working on this.
      I'll try my best to keep it updated and push new things every month.
