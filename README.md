# DiscordMusician
This is a simple MusicBot i wrote in Python, all features and upcomming updates explained below 

 - Intention
   -  This whole bot was basically an idea i had a while ago already.
      But the first time i used the Bot for my own Discord only and havent released it to the public.
      This time i will keep this bot updated for everyone and push updates whenever i find time to edit something.
      Keep in mind, im programming this bot all by myself and I have some more projects running in the background!
      So please just dont ask for next updates or something like that!

-  Config
      If you want to use this Bot on your Server you can either inivite it by using this link *COMING SOON*,
      or by making it your own Bot. You need to go to your Discord applications and then create a new application, add
      a new bot to the application, invite the bot to your server and put the token inside the main.py file at line 12.
      Just replace line 12 with 'token = *YOUR_NEW_BOT_TOKEN*'.

      This is the link to the discord applications: 'https://discord.com/developers/applications'
      This Video may be a little old but you find something about creating bots and inviting them to your server here: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVedJuBojF8'

      If this wont help you just send me a message to 'musician-bot@protonmail.com'!
      I'll try to answer all your questions there =)


-  Other things
   -  As i said in the beginning of this README im a single programmer working on this.
      I'll try my best to keep it updated and push new things every month.
